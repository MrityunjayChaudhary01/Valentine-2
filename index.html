								Okay, so this is how it all started.
							</p>

							<p>
								I asked for tips on how to approach other girls and how to start conversations. I made it clear back then that I didn’t talk to you because you were the only girl I was talking to, but because you were a good friend of mine. I even asked you about what outfit to wear for the annual function, but in the end, I wore exactly what I wanted to wear on the last day.
							</p>

							<p>
								In March, you got upset with me because I didn’t come to meet you and instead went to Parth. I hurt you without realizing how sensitive you can be. And maybe as karma, right after that, I ended up getting chicken pox.
							</p>

							<p>
								Then came May. When you were about to return to Meerut, you were sharing snaps one day. I was teasing you, saying things like “ye nahi dhoya, uska kya?” and you replied to every single one of them. I think that was the day I truly started feeling something for you.
							</p>

							<p>
								When I met you for the first time, I was unusually conscious about myself. Normally, I don’t care much about how I look around my friends—I just wear anything and show up. But that day was different. The moment I saw you, I thought, “Okay… I’m done for sure.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Yes, I liked you—a lot. And maybe you felt it too. I remember waiting in the car for you, then we hung out at McDonald’s. And oh, before that, our plan got cancelled and delayed by a day. My mood was completely ruined. I didn’t have dinner that night, didn’t play any games, stayed up late just singing, listening to songs, and waiting for the next day. And then… came the first day.

								<p>
									So… yeah. The truth is that I kind of liked you.
								</p>

								<p>
									At first, it was because you were such a great friend. But when we met in May for the first time, I started admiring you—really looking at who you are. I wanted to understand why I was feeling this way, what it was about you that was making me fall.
								</p>

								<p>
									No, I wasn’t checking you out. I was observing you. I brought those rings for the same reason—to see if you’d like them, to see how you’d react, to adore you in that moment and watch you feel happy. I knew you wouldn’t be expecting it, and you were surprised… and I think you were happy.
								</p>

								<p>
									Moving on, I didn’t even realize that you noticed me getting disappointed when you changed. I really enjoyed playing badminton with you that day. And after that, I even asked Nitish to play badminton with me at the exact same place—just to relive that moment. But the court was occupied.
								</p>

								<p>
									I just wanted to go back there… to feel that nostalgia of admiring you.
								</p>

								<p>
									And then—boom—you were right there. What a moment that was for me. I intentionally ended the match early just so I could come back to you and return the shuttle. I was trying so hard not to make it obvious… but yeah, that was me.

							<div class="item__content-text">
								<p>
									I think I loved you through your stories and your selflessness—for everyone, not just for me. Your innocence, your pure intentions, and your hypnotizing smile are the reasons I know I will always fall for you.
								</p>

								<p>
									I swear, Poorvi, if someday I’m losing my mind and going completely crazy, just one simple smile of yours can fix everything. I can guarantee that. Because right now, that’s the only thing that truly matters to me.
								</p>

								<p>
									You know how happy I feel when you smile—when you eat well, when you sleep properly. Your happiness makes me happy. I crave you the whole day, I find you in everything around me, and every time I get even the smallest chance, I end up smelling your hanky.
								</p>

								<p>
									I don’t know how to explain this properly, but Poorvi, I admit that I’m not perfect for you. Yet you chose me—and that’s my pleasure. You chose to let me love you—that’s my pleasure. You still believe me every time when I say I won’t hurt you again, and even when I ask for another chance, you never hesitate to say yes and try again.
								</p>

								<p>
									You being in my life… is a pleasure.

							<p>
								Finally… Poorvi, no matter what happens—and I truly mean this—I will always admire you.
							</p>

							<p>
								Even if I’m upset with you for any reason, whether something small or something big, I will always look into your eyes with the same love and affection.
							</p>

							<p>
								Can I ask for one permission?  
								Can I love you forever?
							</p>

							<p>
								I know I’ve been too much at times. I crossed limits, I overdid things, and honestly, I’ve hurt you a lot lately. I don’t even know how to make up for all of that. But with this Valentine’s week—and Valentine’s day—I want things to feel more real, more ours.
							</p>

							<p>
								I really want to understand how you feel. I want to make things right for you. I know you’ve sacrificed a lot because of me, and most of the time you never even mention it. There have been so many incidents where I made you feel terrible, and I hate myself for that.
							</p>

							<p>
								I just hope that you won’t leave me. I hope you’ll trust me when I say that I will be better.
							</p>

							<p>
								I promise you…  
								<b>I WILL BE BETTER. TRUST ME.</b>
